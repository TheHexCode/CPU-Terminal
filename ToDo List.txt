- Should there be CPU Disclaimer Text? If so, what should it say? (C) CPU Larp 2024?
- Should subsequent users be able to see that a terminal is rigged?
- Can users still use the terminal as it's being rooted (formatted)? This question applies to both the rooter and other users.
- Which timers do the items (Security Secret/Power Glove/Shimmerstick) effect?
 -- 30s Cracking Terminal?
 -- Regular Hacking Actions?
 -- 30s Root Device? 5min Root Device Part II?
- Having the CMM Widow and Cocoon means you get +2 Tags after using Slip, right?
- Hacking Example has Paradise Accessing a file, then spending full price to modify it. Accessing the next file is reduced by Repeat, but 
- Is there a functional difference between the basic Cyberdeck skill "When you activate Hacking, gain one extra Tag" and the Pocket Hacker's skill "You may activate this to gain an extra Tag on a device you have already gained Tags on this Scene"?
- Is activating a deck for +1 Tag a Hacking action with the standard 30s timer?
- What is a "Drone" according to the FKD DC-17? Is the entire Terminal a drone or is it a specific entry in the Defenses icon? "You've already gained Tags on" implies the former, but the latter makes more sense
- Do Shimmerstick's increase the cost of the initial access to the Terminal? What about other purely function-based abilities, like Root Device and Brick?
- Can one have multiple cyberdecks? A cyberdeck plus the Power Glove? The item description says yes for the cyberdeck and the Shimmerstick

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use POST instead of GET for term info
- Use SQL Database for term info
- Have multiplayer updates (like deleting an entry) force updates to people's pages? If someone's copying a file that gets deleted, it should break the timer and go back to standby
- Themes
- Make it so that pausing the Rooting process and then refreshing does what it's supposed to. Right now, pausing doesn't update the time until it unpauses, so pausing then refreshing will keep the old time, or will skip to root if time elapses behind the scenes.
- Rename dataCatalog to sound more like the defining source of truth
